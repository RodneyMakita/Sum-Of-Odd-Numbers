## Introduction

Given a triangle of consecutive odd numbers:


                  1
                3   5
              7   9   11
          13    15   17  19
        21  23   25    27   29
        ...



This module provides a function `row_sum_odd_numbers(n)` which calculates the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle.

## Installation
